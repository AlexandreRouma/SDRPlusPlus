# SDR++, The bloat-free SDR software.
![Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/Kv7GW3l.png)
SDR++ is a cross-platform and open source SDR software with the aim of being bloat free and simple to use.

## Current Features
* Uses SoapySDR for wide hardware support
* Hardware accelerated graphics (OpenGL + ImGui)
* SIMD accelerated DSP (parts of the DSP are still missing)
* Cross-platform
* Full waterfall update when possible. Makes browsing signals easier and more pleasant

## Coming soon
* Multi-VFO
* Plugins
* Digital demodulators and decoders
* Quick replay (replay last n seconds, cool if you missed a short signal)

## Small things to add
* Switchable bandwidth for demodulators
* Switchable audio output device and sample rate
* Recording
* Light theme (I know you weirdos exist lol)
* Waterfall color scheme editor
* Switchable fft size
* Bias-T enable/disable
* other small customisation options
* Save waterfall and demod settings between sessions
* "Hide sidebar" option
* Input filter bandwidth option

## Known issues (please check before reporting)
* Random crashes (yikes)
* Gains aren't stepped
* The default gains might contain a bogus value before being adjusted
* Clicks in the audio
* In some cases, it takes a long time to select a device (RTL-SDR in perticular)
* Min and Max buttons can get unachievable values (eg. min > max or min = max);

# Building on Windows
## Requirements
* cmake
* vcpkg (for the packages listed below)
* fftw3
* portaudio
* glfw
* glew
* PothosSDR (for libvolk and SoapySDR)

## The build
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. "-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=C:/Users/Alex/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake" -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64"
cmake --build . --config Release
```

## Copying over needed directories
The last step of the build process is copying the `bandplans` and `res` directories to the output directory.
If you followed the steps above, it should be `build/Release`.

# Building on Linux
coming soon :)

# Building on OSX
coming soon as well :)

# Contributing
Feel free to issue pull request and report bugs via the github issues.
I will soon publish a contributing.md listing the code style to use.

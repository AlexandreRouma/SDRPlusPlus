**Only If SDR++ fails to lauch or the SDR fails to start:**
Run SDR++ from a command line window with special parameters:
* On Windows, open a terminal and `cd` to SDR++'s directory and run `.\sdrpp.exe -c` (if running SDR++ version 1.0.4 or older, use `-s` instead, though you should probably update SDR++ instead...)
* On Linux: Open a terminal and run `sdrpp -c`
* On MacOS: Open a terminal and run `/path/to/the/SDR++.app/Contents/MacOS/sdrpp -c`
Then, post the **entire** logs from start to after the issue. **DOT NOT truncate to where you *think* the error is...**
